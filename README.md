virtualenv <TARGET>
    ```
1. Enter the `<TARGET>` directory, if not done yet:

    ```bash
cd <TARGET>
    ```
1. Activate the virtual environment:

    ```bash
source bin/activate
    ```
1. Install the required Python modules:

    ```
pip install -r requirements.txt

### Usage
To view (and change) the jupyter notebooks in this project, first activate the virtual environment:

```bash
source bin/activate
```
Then, you can start the notebook server:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```
Open the URL displayed on your console in your web browser to access the notebooks.

When you have finished working on the notebooks, you can deactivate the virtual environment:
